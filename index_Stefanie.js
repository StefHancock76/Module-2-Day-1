//2. Change the value of studentLastName to "Newman"

//3. Print in console the following statement: "<value of studentFirstName> <value of studentLastName> has an average grade of <value of average>"
//ex. Jane Doe has an average grade of 100.
console.log(`${studentFirstName + studentLastName}has an average of${[average]}`)
//4. Write code that would answer this question: Did the student pass?
